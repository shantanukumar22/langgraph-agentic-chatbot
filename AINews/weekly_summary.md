# Weekly AI News Summary

<think>
Alright, let me tackle this query. The user wants a summary of AI news articles in markdown format, sorted by date with the latest first. Each entry needs the date in IST, a concise summary, and the source URL. 

First, I'll look at the provided articles. There are 20 entries with dates ranging from October 20 to October 24, 2025. I need to parse each date, convert it to IST if necessary, and check the timezone. The dates given are in GMT, so I'll add 5.5 hours to convert to IST. For example, a date of "21 Oct 2025 12:08:35 GMT" becomes "21 Oct 2025 17:43:35 IST". 

Next, I need to extract the summary. Each article's content varies, so I'll have to identify the key points. For instance, the first article mentions insurers using AI in underwriting and claims. I'll condense that into a concise sentence. 

Sorting is crucial. The latest date is October 24, 2025, with multiple articles on that day. I'll list those first, then October 23, and so on. 

I'll check for duplicate dates and ensure each is correctly formatted as **YYYY-MM-DD**. Also, the sources need to be linked properly. 

I should verify that all summaries are accurate and not just copied from the content. For example, the article about Micron Technology discusses their role in AI infrastructure, so the summary should reflect that. 

Some articles might have similar content, like the ones about AI in education; I need to differentiate their summaries to avoid repetition. 

Finally, I'll structure the markdown with the correct headings and links, ensuring that each entry follows the format exactly as specified. I'll double-check the date conversions and the order to make sure everything is correct.
