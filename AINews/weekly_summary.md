# Weekly AI News Summary

<think>
Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants me to summarize AI-related news articles into markdown format with specific guidelines. First, I need to parse each article's content, extract the relevant information, and structure it according to the given format.

Starting with the date, I notice that some dates are in GMT and need to be converted to IST. Since IST is GMT+5:30, adding that to each date will give the correct IST time. For example, an article posted on 2025-10-24 17:39:31 GMT would be 2025-10-25 03:09:31 IST.

Next, each summary should be concise and highlight the main points. I'll need to read through each article's content and pick out the key information. For instance, the article about Micron Technology mentions their role in AI infrastructure and their recent stock performance. I should mention their HBM chips and the stock's discount.

Sorting the articles by date is crucial. The latest articles are from October 24 and 23. I'll list them in descending order. Also, each summary must include a source URL linked properly. I need to ensure that the summary is not just a link but actually contains the key points of the article.

I also need to check for any duplicates or similar topics to avoid redundancy. For example, there are multiple articles about AI in education and AI in the workplace. Each should be summarized separately to cover different aspects.

Another thing to watch for is the formatting. Headings should be in ### [Date] format, and each summary should be a bullet point with the link. I need to ensure that markdown is correctly applied without any syntax errors.

Lastly, verifying the dates and URLs is important to maintain accuracy. Making sure that each date is correctly converted to IST and that the URLs are properly linked to the articles. If any article doesn't have a clear date or URL, I should note that, but in this case, all provided articles have both.

Putting it all together, I'll start with the most recent date, summarize each article's content briefly, convert the date to IST, and link the source. This way, the final markdown will be organized, informative, and meet the user's requirements.
