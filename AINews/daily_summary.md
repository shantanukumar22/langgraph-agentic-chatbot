# Daily AI News Summary

<think>
Alright, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to summarize AI-related news articles into markdown format with specific formatting. First, I need to parse each article's content and date, converting the date to IST. The dates given are in GMT, so I need to add 5.5 hours for IST. Let me check each date and adjust accordingly.

Next, for each article, I have to extract a concise summary focusing on AI. Some articles might not be AI-related, so I need to filter those out. For example, the first article about the NFL game isn't AI-related, so I'll skip that. The third article is about Microsoft's Mico AI, which is relevant. I'll need to read each content snippet carefully to identify AI mentions.

Sorting the articles by date (latest first) is important. All the dates are from October 26, 2025, except one from October 27. The October 27 article about the startup in plant breeding is the latest, so it should come first.

I need to ensure the summaries are concise and in the user's specified format. Also, include the source URL as a link. Let me go through each entry:

1. **Mon, 27 Oct 2025**: The article about the startup using AI in plant breeding. Summary should mention the AI application in agriculture.

2. **Sun, 26 Oct 2025**: Multiple articles from the same day. Need to process each, check for AI relevance, convert dates to IST (GMT +5:30), and sort by the original GMT date but since they're all the same day, order by time if necessary. Wait, the user wants them sorted by date (latest first), but all are from the same day. Maybe alphabetical by time or just list in the order processed? The user didn't specify, but since they all are same date, just list in the order they appear.

Wait, the user said "Sort news by date wise (latest first)". All are October 26 except the October 27 one. So the oct 27 one is first, then the others in order. For same date, maybe order by original GMT time, but user might not care. Since all are same date, just list in the order they are given.

Now, for each article, extract the key points. For example, the Microsoft Mico AI article: summary should mention the new AI character Mico, its purpose, and comparison to other AI chatbots.

Check for the Business Insider article about AI-created stories: mention the byline and human oversight.

The Mondelez article: using gen AI for marketing videos, cost reduction.

Hyundai and PlusAI's hydrogen truck: AI for optimization.

Cadillac's autonomous driving: Level 3 self-driving with AI.

Poland and Palantir cooperation: AI and cybersecurity.

Agriculture automation with AI: using geospatial and AI for productivity.

Riot Platforms pivot to AI and crypto mining.

Each summary must be a concise sentence or two, capturing the main AI-related point.

Need to avoid any markdown in the thinking, but in the final answer, use the specified markdown format with dates in **YYYY-MM-DD** IST, sorted latest first, and each summary followed by the URL as a link.

Double-check the dates converted to IST. For example, the first article's date is Sun, 26 Oct 2025 07:02:21 GMT. Adding 5:30 gives IST 2025-10-26 12:32:21, so the date remains 2025-10-26. Similarly for others.

Okay, compiling all this into the required format now.
